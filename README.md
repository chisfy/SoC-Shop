## ✨ Inspiration

<p align="center">
This project was based on a hackathon, where I felt my skills fell short and the hackathon was difficult and we couldn't quite figure out how to get the mugs to appear in the cart page. I decided to explore NextJS further to understand the structure and uncover the solution, it was only until my work in the final project that I uncovered the solution...useContext!

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
This was built mobile first, and this greatly helped my understanding of responsive design and CSS positioning and styling.
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Improvement in functionality for the carts so the cart could reflect the number in the basket as a more visual cue instead of just turning red!
Currently, duplicate of mugs are just repeated in the cart page however this could be improved by instead just updating the quantity to be updated to 2!
