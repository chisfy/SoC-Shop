## ✨ Inspiration

<p align="center">
This project was based on a hackathon, where I felt my skills fell short and the hackathon was difficult as we couldn't quite figure out how to get the mugs to appear in the cart page. I decided to explore NextJS further to understand the structure and uncover the solution, it was only until my work in the final project that I uncovered the solution...useContext!

## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
- Understanding viewports and mobile design, how to set position that works for both screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
</p>
<p align="center">
- Exploring react hooks like useContext and again solidfying more knowledge of React and Javascript syntax such as spread/rest operators.
</p>
<p align="center">
- Exploring NextJS, the file routing that goes into creating a webpage and also understanding server-side rendering and how to hydrate pages! I also learnt how to make error pages for incorrect URL paths!
</p>
<p align="center">
- JavaScript knowledge such as spread operators, object structures, array methods like reduce! Getting the cart page total and quantity to work together in sync was the greatest roadblock and glad to have found a way to work!
</p>
<p align="center">
- CSS styling and how to use the pseudo classes and exploring animation
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
This was built mobile first, and this greatly helped my understanding of responsive design as well as CSS positioning and styling.
I enjoyed building the stylised look and the CSS application was the smoothest part of this project!
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Improvement in functionality for the carts so the cart could reflect the number in the basket as a more visual cue instead of just turning red!
Currently, duplicate of mugs are just repeated in the cart page however this could be improved by instead just updating the quantity to be updated to 2 and the behaviour of the delete button malfunctions.
Or, the basket component could possibly be broken down further!
Testing; I have yet to implement written tests, relying on developer environment testing and deployment checks.
